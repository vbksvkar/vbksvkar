- ⚡ Fun fact: In my early days of development role with an enterprise, I happened to delete all the records of a table by issuing a 'delete * from <tablename>' without a where clause. Horrified enough, scrambled around and learnt how to restore the data from a backup. Luckily they had backups till last day and I had access to those backups. This was in late 90s.
